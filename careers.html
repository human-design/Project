            <h1> Are you dreaming of a career in tech? </h1>
            <h4 id="credit">Vicky Torrillas</h4>
              <br>
              <p>In a fast-evolving digital world, and with new technologies being introduced to our lives
                on a daily basis, a tech economy is more real than ever. People can now have their dream job
                 remotely, working in-house or consulting. Some may even begin their tech journey by
                  becoming freelancers through what is now called the `gig economy´, where people
                  focus on project-based jobs rather than being inside of an office from 9am to 5pm.</p>

            <p>If you have never considered working in the tech industry, you may be wondering what
              some of the top careers you could go into. There are several different roles within
              different fields you could explore:</p>

              <br>

              <ul>
                <li><h3>Software Engineer</h3></li>
                <p> A Software Engineer is someone who develops different applications that
                  help the end users achieve tasks on their computers, tablets or phones.
                  This can be done ´in-house´, or you can become a consutant and work off-site.
                  You could even become a freelancer!</p>

                  <br>

                <li><h3>Computer Systems Engineer</h3></li>
                <p>A Computer Systems Engineer designs and implements solutions that will sort
                  system administration issues, network issues or even application issues. They
                  help troubleshoot systems and technical issues the user may be having. They
                  also make sure that the systems are stable and there are no recurrent issues.</p>

                  <br>

                <li><h3>Web Developer</h3></li>
                <p>A Web Developer comes in three kinds - a front-end developer, a back-end developer
                  or a full-stack developer. <br><br>

                <strong>Front-end development</strong> focuses on the visual aspects of a website or app,
                and you will likely be using HTML, CSS or Javascript. They will also work closely with
                 those within User Experience (UX), making sure that the website´s layout and usability
                 are up to par with the user´s needs. <br><br>

                <strong>Back-End development</strong> focuses on the server-side of the development,
                where you will be making sure that the application is communicating between the database
                and the browser. You will use HTML and CSS, but likely you will focus on languages like
                 Java, Ruby, Python and .Net. <br><br>

                <strong> Full-Stack development </strong> translates into a generalist role, as you will
                 have knowledge of both front-end and back-end, but in a lesser scale. You will likely be
                 familiar with all the different languages of coding but not as in-depth as someone in
                 one of the aforementioned positions.

               </p>

               <br>

                <li><h3>Information Security Analyst</h3></li>
                <p> An Information Security Analyst makes sure that there are no holes in the company´s
                  security network, and creates a safety net to avoid data breaches. With news of data
                   breaches daily in newspapers and television, this role has become more important
                   than ever to make sure that data is being safeguarded. They conduct risk
                   assessments, and make sure that staff is educated on how to best avoid a cyber
                   attack or a breach. </p>

                <br>

                <li><h3>Database administrator</h3></li>
                <p>A Database Administrator makes sure that all company data is safeguarded, and is
                  stored in the most effective, efficient manner. They make sure all data is backed up,
                  secured and that only those who have certain privileges are able to access the
                  information in it. </p>

                <br>

                <li><h3>AI Engineer</h3></li>

                <p> Have you used products such as chatbots, voice-commanded phone assistants like
                  Alexa or Siri? That is the work of an AI Engineer. With Artificial Intelligence on
                   the rise, we have seen a rapid inclusion of chatbots within websites, of assistants
                   in phones and other electronics, and robotic automation in phone conversations with
                    banks and customer service. An AI engineer will design new technologies, and make
                    sure that they are stable to be released. </p>

                <br>

                <li><h3>Network Engineer</h3></li>
                <p> A Network Engineer takes care of the infrastructure, rather than the
                  non-phyisical aspects of technology. They make sure that upgrades happen without
                   conflict, that the organisation has strong firewalls and will help troubleshoot
                   issues with the servers. </p>

                <br>

                <li><h3>Video Games Developer</h3></li>

                <p>A Video Game Developer will enjoy a similar career than a web or app developer.
                  There are several aspects to video game design such as the visual graphics,
                  the storyline, and the back-end where the programming makes the magic happen.
                  Videogame development has become quite predominant in the tech field, with people
                  starting their own ´indie´ video game houses, or joining powerhouse companies such
                   as EA or Sega. </p>

                  <br>

                <h3> This list is not exhaustive, but these are some of the many paths you could take if you
                   are considering a career in tech. </h3>

                   <p> All these fields have been technically available for women since
                     the beginning of the century. However, why are we just now seeing such a spurt
                     in women in tech? One reason could be that putting your foot at the door of a tech
                     company does not always mean that you will be able to succeed within it. <br><br>

                     In a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/14/tech-women-code-workshops-developer-jobs"><strong>recent article
                        by the Guardian</strong></a>, Miriam Posner - Assistant Professor in the Information Studies department
                         at UCLA - casts light on the fact that "the technology industry enforces a distinct gender
                         hierarchy between front-end and back-end development. Women are typecast as front-end
                         developers, while men work on the back end – where they generally earn significantly
                         more money than their front-end counterparts." (). Sexism within the workplace could
                         be one of the reasons why women are not joining these fields. <br><br>

                         Another reason could be that they do not feel welcome in spaces where they could
                         learn, and hence they do not approach these opportunities, particularly when
                         thinking about fields like Web Development, AI (Artificial Intelligence),
                         RPA (Robotic Process Automation), IoT (Internet of Things), VR (Virtual Reality)
                         or Cloud. However, women are slowly catching up to the breadth of opportunities
                        that a career in one of these fields can offer by joining organisations like
                        <a href="https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/"><strong>CodeFirst: Girls</strong></a>, or <a href="https://www.womenwhocode.com/"><strong>Women Who Code</strong></a> which are helping level the
                        playing field for women across the UK by providing them with a safe space
                        and the tools and knowledge to have their dream career within tech.
